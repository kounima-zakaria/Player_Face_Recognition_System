## Overview:
This project implements a face recognition system for identifying players, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Hakimi, LeBron James, Lewis Hamilton, and Messi. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to detect and recognize faces in images and assign them to the corresponding player labels.

The dataset used for training the face recognition model consists of images scraped from the internet using a custom web scraping script. The code for scraping the player images can be found in the [Image Scraping from Google](https://github.com/kounima-zakaria/Image_Scraping_from_google) repository.

## Repository Structure:
- **dataset**: Contains the dataset of player images used for training and testing the face recognition model.
- **classification_vf.ipynb**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
